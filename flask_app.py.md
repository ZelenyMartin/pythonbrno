## Creating simple API with Flask on Pythonanywhere

This code demostrates how to create simple API which detects the user's
location a search a flights for him to given destination in given date.

This could be prototype for web widget to conference venues.

It's running here http://kiwicom.pythonanywhere.com/?destination=Budapest

## Why it didn't work we I was doing the live coding?

Meassage from VP of engineering.

> Issue what happened: we released few small things on search but
> our orchestration tool for organize release to whole cluster went crazy
> so it took down everything . We tried to fix it but we were not succesfull.
> So we used new version what we got on testing .
> Issue happened because we have production on not properly finished engine
> for orchestrating clusters and we got already way too much services there.
> Should be better with new version.
> Search was down from 19:03-20:24. Thanks for patience
